# Dockerfile

# Docker CLI

docker build -t friendlyhello .			# Build image from files in current dir; tag/name it "friendlyhello"
docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyhello		# Run image as container with port forwarding 80 -> 4000 (host)

												# This port remapping of 4000:80 is to demonstrate the difference between what you EXPOSE within the Dockerfile, and what you publish using docker run -p

docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyhello 	# detached mode

docker ps								# shows running containers with abbreviated container ID


docker images							# show all locally available images
docker pull [image name]				# download [image name] from current Docker registry

# Workflow

docker tag friendlyhello username/repository:tag
docker push username/repository:tag
docker run -p 4000:80 username/repository:tag

# Note: If you donâ€™t specify the :tag portion of these commands, the tag of :latest will be assumed, both when you build and when you run images.
